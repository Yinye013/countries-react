# countries-react
Hello world! I'm Onyinyechukwu Adesanya, and I built this rest countries informative app about countries with React JS, Sass, and Tailwind CSS. It was a fun experience building it, and I hope you'll have as much fun checking it out!
Here is the live site: https://countries-react-lemon.vercel.app/
Feel free to check out the countries, their details and their borders/Neigboring Countries!
